		<h1><b>Kazakhstan declares state of emergency in Almaty after fuel price protests</b></h1>
		<h4><i>Updated 0258 GMT (1058 HKT) January 5, 2022</i></h4>
		
		<p>Almaty, Kazakhstan Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has declared a two-week state of emergency in the Central Asian nation's biggest city, Almaty, and in the western Mangistau province where protests turned violent, his office said early on Wednesday.<br><br>
The move includes an 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew, movement restrictions, and a ban on mass gatherings, according to documents published on the President's website.<br><br>
"Calls to attack government and military offices are absolutely illegal," Tokayev said in a video address a few hours earlier. "The government will not fall, but we want mutual trust and dialog rather than conflict."<br><br>
As he spoke, police in Almaty used tear gas and stun grenades to stop hundreds of protesters from storming the mayor's office, a Reuters correspondent reported from the scene.<br><br>

The oil-rich country's government said late on Tuesday it was restoring some price caps on liquefied petroleum gas, after the rare protests reached Almaty following a sharp rise in the price of the fuel at the start of the year.<br><br>
Many Kazakhs have converted their cars to run on LPG, which is far cheaper than gasoline as a vehicle fuel in Kazakhstan because of price caps. But the government argued the low price was unsustainable and lifted the caps on January 1.</p>
